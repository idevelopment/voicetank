The Product Management Platform for Building Better Products

## Communicate throughout the entire process

### Run a better beta

Deliver more polished products by working with a feature’s already-engaged supporters to test and provide ongoing feedback so you can iterate before launch

### Drive new feature adoption

Don’t let new features get lost - use supporters as targeted marketing lists when you roll out new capabilities

### Stay in tune with development teams

Automate the process using integrations with issue tracking and development tools like Github.


## Build your roadmap with real data

### Prioritize the features that matter
Define your roadmap with data science and statistical significance, using metrics like revenue and customer satisfaction instead of vote counts

###Validate your own ideas

See how your products plans stack up against user-generated ideas and customer feedback with our SmartVote™ technology

###Build the business case

Strengthen your business case with ROI and estimated customer impact using information from your CRM or internal databases.
